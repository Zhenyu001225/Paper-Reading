Summary:
Problem: 
Many of the defense methods bring additional overhead which is a significant challenge for the secure and efficient deployment of devices with limited resources.
Key ideas:
Unpredictable and input-dependent variations introduced by AC improve the CNN resilience to adversarial perturbations.
Solutions:
TODO: understand the detailed hardware design.
Strengths & Weaknesses:
Strengths: Data-dependent; Without the need for re-training, fine-tuning, or input preprocessing.
Takeaways&How can I do better:
Experiment setups.
